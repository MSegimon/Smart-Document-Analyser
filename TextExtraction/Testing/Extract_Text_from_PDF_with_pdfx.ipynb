The HTTP model\\n\\nis the pe\\x00ect inverse of the RPC model—in the RPC\\n\\nmodel, the addressable units are procedures, and\\n\\nthe entities of the problem domain are hidden\\n\\nbehind the procedures. In the HTTP model, the\\n\\naddressable units are the entities themselves and\\n\\nthe behaviors of the system are hidden behind the\\n\\nentities as side-e\\x00ects of creating, updating, or\\n\\ndeleting them.\\n\\nOne of the remarkable characteristics of the world-\\n\\nwide web is that every address on the web exposes\\n\\nexactly the same API—HTTP. (In the REST\\n\\ndescription of HTTP, this is called the \"uniform\\n\\ninte\\x00ace constraint.\") This means that to navigate\\n\\nthe entire world-wide web, you only need to know a\\n\\nsingle API—this fact is what made possible the\\n\\ndevelopment of the web browser. Unfo\\x00unately,\\n\\nmany of the APIs that claim to be RESTful layer a lot\\n\\nof proprietary concepts on top of HTTP. Essentially,\\n\\nthey invent their own API and use HTTP as a lower-\\n\\nlevel transpo\\x00 layer, rather than using HTTP directly\\n\\nas it was designed. In fact, there’s so much\\n\\nvariability in the way that people use the term REST\\n\\nin the context of APIs that it’s di\\x00cult to know what\\n\\nthey mean by it unless you know them well.\\n\\nBecause HTTP is already so widely known, there’s a\\n\\nlot less to learn about an API that uses HTTP directly\\n\\nthan an RPC one. Learning an RPC API is very similar\\n\\nto learning a programming library. The inte\\x00ace of a\\n\\nprograming library is typically made up of many\\n\\nprocedure signatures that each have to be learned,\\n\\nhttps://cloud.google.com/blog/products/application-development/rest-vs-rpc-what-problems-are-you-trying-to-solve-with-your-apis\\n\\n7/17\\n\\n\\x0c2/15/24, 10:06 AM\\n\\nREST vs. RPC: what problems are you trying to solve with your APIs? | Google Cloud Blog\\n\\nand there’s li\\x00le commonality or predictability\\nCloud\\nbetween procedures in di\\x00erent libraries (and o\\x00en\\n\\nContact sales\\n\\nBlog\\n\\nGet started for free\\n\\nnot even within the same library).\\n\\nBy contrast, learning an API that uses HTTP directly\\n\\nis like learning a database schema. Every database\\n\\nmanaged by the same database management\\n\\nsystem, whether it’s Postgres, MySQL, or Spanner,\\n\\nhas exactly the same API, so you only have to learn\\n\\nthat API once. For an individual database, you only\\n\\nhave to learn the tables and their columns , and\\n\\n2\\n\\ntheir meanings; compared to a typical programming\\n\\nlibrary, there is much less detail to learn in a\\n\\ndatabase. An API that uses HTTP directly, like a\\n\\ndatabase, is mostly de\\x00ned by its data model. What\\n\\nabout querying, you ask? It’s true that complex\\n\\nqueries—beyond simple create, retrieve, update and\\n\\ndelete—are impo\\x00ant in APIs as they are in\\n\\ndatabases, and that HTTP does not give us a\\n\\nstandard query syntax for its API in the way that a\\n\\ndatabase management system does, so there is\\n\\ntypically more to learn that is speci\\x00c to an HTTP\\n\\nAPI than to a database. But it’s still much less than a\\n\\ncorresponding RPC API, and the query syntax\\n\\nexposed by most APIs is much simpler than a\\n\\ndatabase management system’s. (One exception\\n\\nmight be if the API includes something like\\n\\nGraphQL, in which case you have the compensating\\n\\nbene\\x00t that the query language is the same for\\n\\nmany APIs.)\\n\\nIf an API uses HTTP simply and directly, it will only\\n\\nhave to document three or four things.

The data model exposed\\n\\nby each API may be di\\x00erent, but the mechanisms\\n\\nfor accessing and changing the data will be the\\n\\nsame for all of them.\\n\\nAn essential pa\\x00 of the problem in most integration\\n\\napplications is de\\x00ning relationships between\\n\\nentities that are maintained in di\\x00erent systems. For\\n\\nexample, \\x00ight reservations, hotel reservations, car\\n\\nreservations, credit card payments, and approvals\\n\\nall need to be linked together to manage a trip\\n\\nreservation or its reimbursement. In order to link\\n\\nthese entities together, each must have a clear\\n\\nidentity by which it can be referenced outside of the\\n\\napplication in which it is housed. The world-wide\\n\\nweb standards de\\x00ne the concept of a URL, an\\n\\nidenti\\x00er for a resource that is valid everywhere\\n\\n(hence the name world-wide), not just locally in the\\n\\nAPI of a pa\\x00icular system. This is very helpful for\\n\\nintegration applications because the problem is\\n\\nalready solved for all entities that are accessed by\\n\\nAPIs that use HTTP directly. By contrast, in RPC-\\n\\nbased APIs the identity of an entity is almost always\\n\\nexpressed in a form that is local to the application\\n\\nthat houses it, pu\\x00ing the burden onto the\\n\\ndeveloper to de\\x00ne an identity for each entity that\\n\\nis valid outside that application.\\n\\nhttps://cloud.google.com/blog/products/application-development/rest-vs-rpc-what-problems-are-you-trying-to-solve-with-your-apis\\n\\n10/17\\n\\n\\x0c2/15/24, 10:06 AM\\n\\nREST vs. RPC: what problems are you trying to solve with your APIs? | Google Cloud Blog\\n\\nBlog\\n\\nContact sales\\n\\nHow HTTP helps make\\nCloud\\nsoftware easier to\\nchange\\n\\nGet started for free\\n\\nWhat about the di\\x00culty of modifying so\\x00ware—\\n\\ncan HTTP/REST help there too?

That way, anyone\\n\\nwho knows HTTP from the standards documents or\\n\\na multitude of less formal tutorials will be able to\\n\\nuse your API, with no more documentation than a\\n\\ndescription of the API\\'s entity model and a li\\x00le bit\\n\\nof query syntax.
